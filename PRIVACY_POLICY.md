# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** #Start Date

This Privacy Policy outlines the data collection, usage, and security practices for the **Ads Click-Through Rate (CTR) Prediction Project**. This project analyzes Pinterest ad data to predict ad and campaign performance, enabling users to make informed marketing decisions while respecting data privacy.

## 1. Data Collection

### Types of Data Collected
- **Pinterest Ad Analytics Data**: This includes metrics such as impressions, clicks, engagement rate, and spend, retrieved from the Pinterest API. 
- **User-Generated Input**: Any additional user-provided data used for testing or model training (e.g., uploaded ad datasets).

### Collection Method
Data is collected using the Pinterest Ads API, which requires a valid API token, client ID, and account ID. The data retrieved aligns with the permissions granted by Pinterest to your Pinterest Business account.

## 2. Data Usage

### Purpose of Data Use
The collected data is solely used for:
- Training and testing the CTR prediction model.
- Evaluating and improving model accuracy for campaign performance prediction.
- Providing insights on ad performance to improve future campaign targeting and engagement strategies.

### Data Retention
Data collected will only be retained as long as necessary for model training and validation purposes. Users may delete any locally stored data after training is complete.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

Data is **not** shared, sold, or disclosed to third parties. Data access is restricted to authorized project contributors for the sole purpose of developing and optimizing the CTR prediction model.

## 4. Data Security

We prioritize data security and implement the following measures:
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive credentials (API token, client ID) are stored in an environment file (`.env`) that is kept private and not shared in the repository.
- **Access Control**: Only authorized personnel have access to the API credentials required for data collection.
- **Data Anonymization**: All data processed is anonymized, and personally identifiable information (PII) is neither requested nor stored.

## 5. User Control Over Data

Users have full control over the data collected by the project:
- **API Access**: Users are responsible for managing their own Pinterest API credentials.
- **Data Deletion**: Data may be deleted at any time by removing the files from local storage.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in data practices or legal requirements. We encourage users to review this document regularly for any updates.
